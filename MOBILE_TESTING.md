# üì± Mobile Testing Guide

## Quick Steps to Test on Your Phone

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Find Your Computer's IP Address

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for **IPv4 Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

**Example output:**
```
Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Frontend with Network Access

**Stop your current frontend** (Ctrl+C) and run:
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

You'll see:
```
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/  ‚Üê Use this on mobile!
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access from Your Phone

1. **Connect phone to same WiFi** as your computer
2. **Open browser** on phone (Chrome/Safari)
3. **Type the Network URL**: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`
   - Replace with YOUR IP address from step 1

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Computer and phone on same WiFi network
- [ ] Backend running (`cd backend && npm start`)
- [ ] Frontend running with `--host` flag (`npm run dev:mobile`)
- [ ] Firewall allows connections on port 5173 and 5000
- [ ] Using the Network URL (not localhost)

## üî• Firewall Issues?

If you can't connect from mobile, Windows Firewall might be blocking it.

**Allow Node.js through firewall:**
1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall**
2. Click **"Allow an app through firewall"**
3. Find **Node.js** and check both Private and Public
4. Click OK

Or temporarily disable firewall for testing (not recommended for production).

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com/api
   ```
4. Deploy frontend
5. Access from anywhere!

## üí° Tips

- **Add to Home Screen**: In mobile browser, use "Add to Home Screen" for app-like experience
- **PWA**: Consider adding service worker for offline support
- **HTTPS**: For production, always use HTTPS
- **Performance**: Mobile networks are slower - optimize images and API calls

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Can't connect from mobile?
1. Check both devices on same WiFi
2. Verify IP address is correct
3. Check Windows Firewall settings
4. Try disabling VPN if active
5. Restart both servers

### App loads but shows "Offline mode"?
- Backend might not be accessible from mobile
- Check backend is running on `0.0.0.0:5000` not `localhost:5000`
- Verify firewall allows port 5000

### Slow performance?
- Check WiFi signal strength
- Clear browser cache
- Check backend logs for errors
