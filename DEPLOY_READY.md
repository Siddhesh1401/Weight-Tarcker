   - Saved to database ✅

2. **Device B (Phone):**
   - Open app
   - Settings → Email → Shows: Daily: 08:00, Weekly: 10:30, Monthly: 19:00
   - Settings → Cron → Shows: API key `abc123`
   - Synced! ✅

3. **Create Cron Jobs:**
   - Click "Setup Email Cron Jobs"
   - Creates 3 jobs with YOUR times:
     - Daily: 08:00 UTC
     - Weekly: 10:30 Monday UTC

## 📊 Database Structure

Your user document now looks like:
```json
{
  "_id": "user_001",
  "name": "User",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "goal_weight": 70,
  "email_notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "daily_summary": true,
    "weekly_summary": true,
    "monthly_summary": false,
    "schedule": {
      "daily": "08:00",    // ← Your time!
      "weekly": "10:30",   // ← Your time!
      "monthly": "19:00"   // ← Your time!
    }
  },
  "cron_api_key": "your-secret-key"  // ← Your key!
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Timezone:
- All times are in **24-hour format** (HH:MM)
- Cron jobs run in **UTC timezone**
- If you want 8 AM your local time, calculate UTC offset
- Example: PST is UTC-8, so 8 AM PST = 16:00 UTC

### API Key Security:
- Your cron-job.org API key is stored in MongoDB
- Make sure MongoDB is secured
- Use environment variables for sensitive keys in production

### Cron Schedule Format:
```
User Input  →  Cron Format
08:00       →  0 8 * * *      (Daily at 8 AM)
10:30       →  30 10 * * 1    (Monday at 10:30 AM)
19:00       →  0 19 1 * *     (1st at 7 PM)
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Everything is working when:
- ✅ Email settings persist after refresh
- ✅ Email settings sync across devices
- ✅ Cron API key persists after refresh
- ✅ Cron API key syncs across devices
- ✅ Cron jobs created successfully (no 500 error)
- ✅ Cron jobs use your schedule times
- ✅ Cron jobs use your API key
- ✅ No errors in browser console
- ✅ Database has all settings

## 🐛 If Something Fails

### 500 Error Still Appears:
1. Make sure you pushed the changes
2. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. Clear browser cache

### Settings Don't Sync:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for API calls
3. Verify MongoDB connection
4. Check if using same user_id on both devices

### Cron Jobs Wrong Time:
1. Check Settings → Email → Verify times are correct
2. Delete old cron jobs from cron-job.org
3. Recreate with "Setup Email Cron Jobs" button
4. Verify times in cron-job.org dashboard
