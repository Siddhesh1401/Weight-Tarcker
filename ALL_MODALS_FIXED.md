## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

### The Core Pattern Applied to ALL Modals:

```tsx
// Outer container - enables viewport scrolling
<div className="fixed inset-0 ... overflow-y-auto">
  
  // Inner container - constrains modal size
  <div className="... my-8 max-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)] flex flex-col">
    
    // Header - stays at top (sticky)
    <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
      Title and close button
    </div>
    
    // Content - scrolls independently
    <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto ... scrollbar-thin">
      All your content here
    </div>
    
    // Footer - stays at bottom (sticky)
    <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
      Action buttons
    </div>
    
  </div>
</div>
```
