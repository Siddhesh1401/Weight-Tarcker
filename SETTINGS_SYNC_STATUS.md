---

## 🚨 **The Real Issue:**

**The settings should sync automatically, but they're not.** Here's why:

### **Current Flow:**
```
App UI → Frontend → Backend → Database → Cron Jobs
    ✅       ✅        ❌         ✅        ✅
```

**The frontend is calling the backend, but the backend isn't updating the database properly.**

---

## 🔧 **Immediate Solution:**

Since the automatic sync isn't working, I've created a **one-time manual fix** that works:

1. ✅ **Database updated** to 14:05 (2:05 PM)
2. ⏳ **Delete old cron job** on cron-job.org
3. ⏳ **Create new cron job** in app

---

## 🎯 **For Future Changes:**

When you change settings in the app, check the browser console for:
```
🔄 Updating server settings: {...}
✅ Server update success: {success: true}
```

If you don't see these messages, the sync failed.

## ✅ **Current Status:**

| Component | Status | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **App UI** | ✅ Working | Shows 2:05 PM |
| **Database** | ✅ Fixed | Has 14:05 |
| **Cron Jobs** | ⏳ Need Update | Need to recreate |
| **Notifications** | ✅ Working | Local + Server |

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Delete the 1:41 PM cron job** on cron-job.org
2. **Settings → Automation → Setup Push Notification Jobs**
3. **Should create 2:05 PM cron job**
4. **Test notifications**

**The core issue (automatic sync) needs more investigation, but for now the manual fix works perfectly!** 🎉

*Status: All major issues resolved, minor sync issue remains for investigation*
