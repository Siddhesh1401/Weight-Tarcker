## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Add to Home Screen" not showing**
**Solution:**
- Make sure manifest.json is accessible: `your-url.vercel.app/manifest.json`
- Check browser console for manifest errors
- Ensure HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)

### **Problem: Notification permission denied**
**Android:**
```
Settings → Apps → Weight Tracker → Permissions → Notifications → Allow
```

**iOS:**
```
Settings → Notifications → Weight Tracker → Allow Notifications
```

### **Problem: Notifications not showing up**
**Checklist:**
1. [ ] Notifications enabled in app settings
2. [ ] Browser/OS permission granted
3. [ ] App installed as PWA (works better)
4. [ ] Service worker registered (check browser DevTools)
5. [ ] Time set correctly (not in the past)

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Check **Service Workers** section
4. Verify service worker is running
5. Check **Manifest** section
6. Verify manifest loaded correctly

### **Problem: Service worker not registering**
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Uninstall and reinstall PWA
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify `sw.js` is in `public/` folder
5. Ensure HTTPS

### **Problem: Notifications work in browser but not in PWA**
**Solution:**
- iOS has limited background notification support
- Android works fully
- Try testing on Android first
- On iOS, notifications work better when app is in background (not fully closed)
