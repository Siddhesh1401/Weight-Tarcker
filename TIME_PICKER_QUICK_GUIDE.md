# ⏰ Quick Time Picker Guide

## What's New?

You can now **edit the time** when logging entries! Perfect for when you log meals/weight/water/sleep at a different time than when they actually happened.

## How It Works

### Every Log Modal Now Has a Time Picker:

**Before Saving:**
```
[Your entry details]

⏰ Time of Meal
┌──────────────────┐
│ 10:30           │  ← Click to change!
└──────────────────┘
Default is current time, edit if needed

[Cancel] [Save]
```

### Two Ways to Use:

**1. Real-Time Logging (No Change Needed)**
- Fill in details
- Leave time as-is
- Click Save
- ✅ Logged with current time

**2. Backfill/Custom Time**
- Fill in details
- Click time input
- Select actual time (e.g., 8:00 AM)
- Click Save
- ✅ Logged with your chosen time

## Example: Late Breakfast Logging

**Situation:** Had breakfast at 8:00 AM, but logging at 11:00 AM

**Steps:**
1. Open Breakfast log (shows 11:00 by default)
2. Select your meal preset
3. Change time to 08:00
4. Click Save

**Result:** History shows "Breakfast - 8:00 AM" ✨

## Time Labels by Log Type

- **Meals:** "Time of Meal"
- **Cheat Meals:** "Time of Meal"  
- **Weight:** "Time of Measurement"
- **Water:** "Time of Entry"
- **Sleep:** "Wake Up Time"

## Tips

✅ **Don't stress** - default time is already correct for real-time logging  
✅ **Backfilling?** Just change the time before saving  
✅ **Accuracy matters** - better insights with correct times  
✅ **Works offline** - time syncs when you go online  

## Mobile Support

Works great on phones! Uses native time picker:
- iOS: Scrollable wheel picker
- Android: Material time picker
- Desktop: Standard time input

**That's it!** Now you can track **when** things actually happened, not just **that** they happened. 🎉
