## üîß **Troubleshooting Mobile Issues**

### **‚ùå "No notifications received on mobile"**

**Check 1: Browser Notification Permission**
- Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Chrome ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Enabled
- iOS: Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Website Data ‚Üí Check permissions

**Check 2: System Notification Settings**

**Check 3: Battery Optimization**
- Android: Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization ‚Üí Chrome ‚Üí Don't optimize
- iOS: No battery optimization needed

**Check 4: Service Worker Status**
```javascript
// Open browser console on mobile (use Chrome DevTools remote debugging)
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => {
  console.log('Service Workers:', regs);
});
```

**Check 5: Push Subscription**
```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
  return reg.pushManager.getSubscription();
}).then(sub => {
  console.log('Push Subscription:', sub);
});
```
