# Modal Scroll Fixes - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Desktop Modal Scroll Issue**
- **Problem**: The "Log Breakfast" modal (MealTypeSelector) was cutting off content at the bottom, making the Cancel button partially visible and preventing proper scrolling.
- **Solution**: Restructured the modal to use a flex column layout with proper overflow handling.

### 2. **Mobile Modal Scroll Issue**
- **Problem**: The "Log Dinner" modal (MealLog) had too many presets, causing content to overflow beyond the viewport and making the Save button inaccessible.
- **Solution**: Added constrained scrolling to the presets grid and improved overall modal structure.

## Technical Changes

### Components Updated

#### 1. **MealTypeSelector.tsx**
- ✅ Added `overflow-y-auto` to outer container for viewport scrolling
- ✅ Added `my-8` margin for proper spacing
- ✅ Changed modal max-height to `max-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]`
- ✅ Restructured to use `flex flex-col` with:
  - `flex-shrink-0` for header
  - `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` for content
  - `flex-shrink-0` for footer (sticky buttons)

#### 2. **MealLog.tsx**
- ✅ Improved preset grid scrolling with `max-h-48` and custom scrollbar
- ✅ Added `scrollbar-thin` class for better visual appearance
- ✅ Added right padding (`pr-2`) to prevent scrollbar overlap
- ✅ Already had proper modal structure with sticky footer

#### 3. **MealPresetManager.tsx**
- ✅ Updated outer container to include `overflow-y-auto`
- ✅ Changed max-height to `max-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` with `my-8`
- ✅ Added `scrollbar-thin` class to content area
- ✅ Added `flex-shrink-0` to footer for sticky behavior

#### 4. **index.css**
- ✅ Added custom scrollbar utilities:
  - `.scrollbar-thin` for webkit browsers
  - Scrollbar styling for both light and dark modes
  - Firefox scrollbar support

### Modal Structure Pattern

All modals now follow this consistent pattern:

```tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 ... overflow-y-auto">
  <div className="... my-8 max-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)] flex flex-col">
    {/* Header - Fixed */}
    <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
      ...
    </div>
    
    {/* Content - Scrollable */}
    <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto ... scrollbar-thin">
      ...
    </div>
    
    {/* Footer - Fixed */}
    <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
