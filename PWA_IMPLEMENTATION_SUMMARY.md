## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Technology Stack:**
- React 18.3 + TypeScript
- Service Worker API
- Notification API
- LocalStorage API
- Vite build system

### **Browser Support:**
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile) - Full support
- ✅ Safari (iOS 16.4+) - Good support
- ✅ Firefox (Desktop) - Good support
- ⚠️ Safari (iOS) - Limited background notifications

### **Requirements:**
- HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)
- User permission for notifications
- PWA installation (recommended for best experience)

### **Data Storage:**
- Notification settings → localStorage
- Service worker → Browser cache
- No backend required for notifications

---

## 📱 How It Works

### **Initialization Flow:**
```
1. User opens app
2. Service worker registers (public/sw.js)
3. PWA manifest loads (public/manifest.json)
4. User goes to Settings
5. Enables "Smart Reminders"
6. Browser asks for permission
7. User grants permission
8. NotificationService initializes
9. Schedules all enabled reminders
10. Saves settings to localStorage
```

### **Notification Flow:**
```
1. Timer fires at scheduled time
2. NotificationService checks if already logged
3. If not logged → Shows notification
4. If logged → Skips notification
5. User taps notification
6. App opens (service worker handles click)
```

### **Smart Logic:**
```javascript
// Example: Breakfast reminder
if (currentTime === breakfastTime) {
  const hasLogged = checkIfMealLogged('breakfast', today);
  if (!hasLogged) {
    showNotification('🍳 Breakfast Time!', 'Don\'t forget to log your breakfast');
  }
  // If already logged, skip notification
}
```
