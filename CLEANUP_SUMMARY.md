# 🧹 Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

Deleted one-time debugging/cleanup scripts that are no longer needed:

- ❌ **`backend/scripts/cleanup-duplicates.js`** - Used to find and remove duplicate entries (job done!)
- ❌ **`backend/scripts/delete-old-duplicate.js`** - Used to manually delete specific duplicate (job done!)
- ❌ **`npm run cleanup`** script from `package.json`

## Files Kept

### Development Tools:
- ✅ **`backend/scripts/seed.js`** - Useful for seeding database with test data
- ✅ **`backend/scripts/view-logs.js`** - Useful for viewing all database logs (debugging)

### Usage:
```bash
# Seed database with sample data
cd backend
npm run seed

# View all logs in database
npm run view-logs
```

## Why We Removed Them

The cleanup scripts were created to fix the duplicate issue. Now that:
1. ✅ The root cause is fixed (MongoDB _id-based updates)
2. ✅ Database is cleaned (duplicates removed)
3. ✅ New duplicates won't be created

These scripts are no longer needed! 🎉

Clean and organized! ✨
