## 📞 Need Icons?

**Note:** For production, you'll need proper app icons:
- 192x192 PNG (icon-192.png)
- 512x512 PNG (icon-512.png)
- Maskable versions for Android

You can use tools like:
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Or design custom icons in Figma/Canva

For now, the favicon.svg works, but PNG icons give better results on all devices!
