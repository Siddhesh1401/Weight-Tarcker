## ⚠️ One Cosmetic Issue (Non-Critical)

```
GET https://weight-tarcker.vercel.app/icon-192.png 404 (Not Found)
```

**Impact**: None! Notifications still work perfectly
**Effect**: Uses browser's default bell icon instead of custom icon
**Fix Applied**: Changed code to use `/favicon.svg` (your green WT logo)

## 🎯 What Will Happen Next

### Tomorrow Morning:
- **7:00 AM** - ⚖️ "Weight Check - Log your weight for today"
- **8:00 AM** - 🍳 "Breakfast Time! - Don't forget to log your breakfast"
- **9:00 AM** - ✨ "Daily Motivation - [Random motivational quote]"

### Tomorrow Afternoon:
- **1:00 PM** - 🍽️ "Lunch Time! - Remember to log your lunch"
- **Every 2 hours** - 💧 "Hydration Reminder - Time to drink some water!"

### Tomorrow Evening:
- **8:00 PM** - 🍲 "Dinner Time! - Time to log your dinner"
- **10:00 PM** - 😴 "Sleep Reminder - Don't forget to log your sleep"

**All notifications will automatically reschedule for the next day after firing!**

---

## 🚀 Final Deployment

Apply the icon fix (uses existing favicon instead of missing PNG):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Use favicon.svg for notification icon"
git push
```

After this deploys (~30 seconds), the 404 error will be gone and notifications will show your green WT logo!
