# Push Notification Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ Partial Functionality

### Issue: FCM Endpoint Format Changed
The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notification endpoint format has been updated by Google. The old `/fcm/send/` endpoint is deprecated.

**Error Message:**
```
WebPushError: Received unexpected response code 404
Body: A valid push subscription endpoint should be specified in the URL as such: 
https://fcm.googleapis.com/wp/dHIoDxE7Hdg:APA91bH1Zj0kNa...
```

### What Still Works ✅
- ✅ All app functionality (meals, water, weight, sleep logging)
- ✅ Date/Time picker for logging entries
- ✅ Meal preset management with drag-and-drop reordering
- ✅ Dashboard and history views
- ✅ Data sync with MongoDB backend
- ✅ Dark mode
- ✅ PWA installation

### What Needs Attention ⚠️
- ⚠️ Push notifications may not be delivered on some browsers
- ⚠️ Chrome/Edge on mobile may experience notification issues
- ⚠️ Test notification on subscription fails (but subscription is saved)

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Use Alternative Browsers
Push notifications should work better on:
- Firefox (uses Mozilla Push Service)
- Safari (uses Apple Push Notification Service)
- Desktop Chrome (usually more reliable than mobile)

#### Option 2: Disable Notifications Temporarily
The app works perfectly without push notifications. You can:
1. Continue using the app normally
2. Set manual reminders on your phone
3. Check the app periodically throughout the day

#### Option 3: Re-subscribe to Notifications
If notifications stop working:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Toggle notifications **OFF** then **ON** again
3. Grant permission when prompted

### Technical Details

The issue is related to Chrome's FCM endpoint format change. The current web-push library generates subscriptions with the old endpoint format:
- ❌ Old: `https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/[token]`
- ✅ New: `https://fcm.googleapis.com/wp/[token]`

### Fixes Applied
✅ Added better error handling to prevent crashes
✅ Subscription still saved even if test notification fails
✅ Invalid subscriptions automatically cleaned up (410 errors)
✅ Detailed logging for debugging

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Update to latest web-push library version
- [ ] Implement Firebase Admin SDK for better FCM support
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed notifications
- [ ] Store subscriptions in MongoDB instead of memory
- [ ] Add notification delivery status tracking

## Bottom Line
**The app works great!** Push notifications are a nice-to-have feature, but the core functionality of the weight tracker is fully operational. If notifications are important to you, try using Firefox or desktop Chrome for better reliability.
