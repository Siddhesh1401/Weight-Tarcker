## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: I've never used MongoDB Atlas before**
→ Follow `backend/MONGODB_SETUP.md` - it has screenshots and step-by-step instructions

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
→ Check `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` - it has troubleshooting for common issues

**Q: Can I use this without MongoDB?**
→ Yes! The app has offline mode with mock data, but you won't have data persistence

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
→ You should see no "Offline mode" warning, and data should save to MongoDB Atlas

**Q: Where do I put my MongoDB connection string?**
→ In `backend/.env` file (create it from `backend/.env.example`)
