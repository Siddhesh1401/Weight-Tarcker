## 🚨 If Not Working

### Check Permission
**iOS**: Settings → [Your Browser] → Notifications → Allow
**Android**: Settings → Apps → [Browser] → Notifications → Allow

### Check PWA Installation
- Must be installed via "Add to Home Screen"
- Opening in browser tab won't work reliably

### Check iOS Version
- Requires **iOS 16.4 or later**
- Check: Settings → General → About → Software Version

### Check Console
1. Enable remote debugging (see above)
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify you see:
   - `✅ Permission granted`
   - `📊 Active timers: 7`

### iOS-Specific Issues
- **Low Power Mode**: Disables background notifications
  - Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode → OFF
- **Focus Mode**: May block notifications
  - Control Center → Focus → OFF
- **App Termination**: iOS kills inactive web apps
  - Open app occasionally to keep it active

### Android-Specific Issues
- **Battery Optimization**: May kill background tasks
